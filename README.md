# Dropkick

A tool to help you organize your engineering patterns.

## Features (WIP)

- `dk` - Opens an interactive TUI folder view of all local templates.  You can pull in files or kicklets from this interface.
- `dk --checkout template/file_name` - Checks out a file from a template and drops it into the local folder
- `dk --kicklet kicklet_name` - Checks out all files from a "kicklet" into the working tree.  A kicklet is defined in a template's `bundlegem.yaml` file.
